Hi there! I'm **Liam Nguyen** — a **Business graduate** turned **Full-Stack Developer** based in Vietnam 🇻🇳.

After several years working on WordPress and digital projects, I discovered my passion for building scalable web applications.
Now, I’m diving deep into **software development**, focusing on **Ruby on Rails**, **React**, and **TypeScript**.

## What I’m Working On

Currently, I’m developing my first full-stack project —
the **[Ticket Helpdesk System](https://helpdesk.codebyliam.com){:target="_blank"}**,
an open-source, mail-based ticketing platform that integrates directly with Gmail and Outlook.

It’s designed to help freelancers and teams **manage support emails** more efficiently —
turning every incoming email into a **trackable, collaborative ticket**.
